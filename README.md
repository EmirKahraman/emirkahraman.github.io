This website is a unique, terminal-themed portfolio designed to reflect a minimal and functional aesthetic — much like the tools engineers and developers use daily. Visitors can explore my work, background, and skills through an interface inspired by classic command-line terminals. It’s not just a portfolio, but an homage to the simplicity and power of the shell.
